# Ads List

When I started this project, I always had in mind to make my own AdBlocker, with a different approach, using my own Proxy, but achieving the same goal. I found these links that can be used to store the exact hosts and thus block the URLs. These files are quite extensive, so I think I'll leave them in the `.gitignore`, but they can be added here and then used in the script [load-ads.py](../scripts/load-ads.py) (all host files must be `.txt`).
