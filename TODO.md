# Tasks

## TODO

- Make all `block-ads` logic
- Make a bin to generate new certificates. Only use the utils functions and that should be all
- Make a whitelist to avoid TLS interception
- Make a fallback plan when failing TLS certificates (e.g., when a use does not trust certs), like implement a fallback to plain TCP tunnel
- Refactor all the code; there are duplicated schemas and some things may go elsewhere
- It might be a good idea to do unit testing even if it's a small project
